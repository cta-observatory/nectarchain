For ChargeResolution.py:

1. Update the run_list.json with runs, ff_voltage and NSB level.
2. Pixels and modules to be rejected are specified in bad_pix_module.json
3. Running the code : python ChargeResolution.py -t 14 -e 1000 -o output
4. While calling ChargeResolutionTestTool, ff_coeff options: 1. Independent method of computation, 2. The 2-D gaussian model way, 
	If nothing is specified or integers other than 1 or 2 are passed, then ff_coeff=1.


For linearity.py

1. FF coefficients same as ChargeResolution.py
